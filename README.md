## Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks 2020
## Due: last commit on or before December 18th, 2020

Undergraduate of Computing (Data Analytics) at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. This repository contains the instructions for the Tasks assessment for the ``Fundamentals of Data Analysis`` module in 2020. The assessment is worth 50% of the marks for the module. Four tasks will be presented at different times during the semester and all will be completed in a single [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/E6985/fda-tasks/blob/master/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Tasks-2020.ipynb)

#### Marking Scheme
1. ``25%`` - Research - Evidence of research performed on topic; submission based on referenced literature, particularly academic literature; evidence of understanding of the documentation for any software or libraries used.

2. ``25%`` - Development - Environment can be set up as described; code works without tweaking and as described; code is efficient, clean, and clear; evidence of consideration of standards and conventions appropriate to code of this kind.

3. ``25%`` - Consistency - Evidence of planning and project management; pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by well-considered commit history; commits are of a reasonable size; consideration of how commit history will be perceived by others.

4. ``25%`` - Documentation - Clear documentation of how to create an environment in which any code will run, how to prepare the code for running, how to run the code including setting any options or flags, and what to expect upon running the code. Concise descriptions of code in comments and README.

#### Getting Started
- Keeping in mind the impression given to someone who is looking at this repository, this submission is to provide direct evidence of each of the items listed in each category - ``Research`` - ``Development`` - ``Consistency`` - ``Documentation`` - refer ``Marking Scheme`` above.

1. Research:

	- ***Evidence of research performed on topic***: Each topic/section will have its own ``Reference`` area - topic/section 1 will be referenced as ``1.?`` - topic/section 2 will be referenced as ``2.?`` - and so on. Where possible references will be in the format:

		- [task-number.number] authorNames, referenceTitle, locationWebsiteBookVideo, dateMonthYear.

	- ***Submission based on referenced literature, particularly academic literature***: Start within Wikipedia using academic literature references specified. Demonstrating work completed in the submission with good references and not just for the problem but for level of understanding of the problem.

	- ***Evidence of understanding of the documentation for any software or libraries used***: Code comments will include details of package, module, function, object, method, attribute if applicable to demonstrate understanding of software documentation and libraries used.

2. Development:

	- ***Environment can be set up as described***: Follow exact instruction regarding number of Notebooks/files required.

	- ***Code works without tweaking and as described***: Using Jupyter Notebook markdown cells to summarise concise workings. 

	- ***Code is efficient, clean, and clear***: Individual code statements will have single Jupyter Notebook code cell unless user-defined functions are created. 

	- ***Evidence of consideration of standards and conventions appropriate to code of this kind***: As much as possible use ``Style Guide for Python Code`` [Guido van Rossum](https://web.archive.org/web/20201029095211/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). User-defined coding conventions to be given separate section - refer ``Coding Conventions`` - within README as and when presented (note good commits do not change many different files - when a user-defined coding convention is represented within a Jupyter Notebook then the commit completed will include an update to this README file - this will be the only time this will happen given that to update README every time is wasteful):- 

3. Consistency:

	- ***Evidence of planning and project management***: This README will form the template for this and all future tasks/projects. Git commit to include within the blurb the number of days outstanding before deadline.

	- ***Pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by well-considered commit history***: Endeavour to submit work every day worthy of a git commit. At best 4/5 times per week. Later presentation of topics/sections will require more commits to ensure equal proof of work for all before the deadline.

	- ***Commits are of a reasonable size***: Correctly use git history by putting in a little blurb - 2/3 lines. 

	- ***Consideration of how commit history will be perceived by others***: Commits to highlight changes made since the last commit so that reviews of the git history can demonstrate compartmentation of work into the different sections.   

4. Documentation - 

	- ***Clear documentation of how to create an environment in which any code will run, how to prepare the code for running, how to run the code including setting any options or flags, and what to expect upon running the code***: Separate section - refer ``Environment`` - within README - to be completed closer to the deadline.

	- ***Concise descriptions of code in comments and README***: Comments to be very concise for ease of readability. Descriptions of code requiring further explanation will be presented in Jupyter Notebook markdown cells prior to code execution.   

#### Considerations

- The four listed categories - ``Research`` - ``Development`` - ``Consistency`` - ``Documentation`` - are each worth 25%. 

- Designed not only to be about programming but also about looking at information - data - manipulating the data and coming up with techniques. 

- Sometimes the most complex algorithms are counter-intuitive but do work and have been proven to work. Sometimes only a few lines of code is required to complete a topic/section but to obtain full marks it is not good enough to submit the lines of code. Must explain how the algorithm was developed and the reasoning behind why/how the code works.

- Jupyter Notebook text formatting/presentation to be tidied up closer to the deadline.

#### Coding Conventions

- ``Getting Started`` > ``Development``

#### Environment

- ``Getting Started`` > ``Documentation``
